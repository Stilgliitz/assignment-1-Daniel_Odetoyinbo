        <p class="reporttext"> Overall, designing this webpage has come with a lot of challenges and understanding to
            what different
            tags, components and has vastly strengthend my overall knowledge on this module. There was quite a few
            challenges faced when
            designing this website-such as... Mobile Optimization, Hamburger icon design, etc. However, despite this, I
            was able to overcome
            these issues by taking a step back a rereading my code to understand where I could've possibly gone wrong -
            this wasn't very easy.
            The use of responsive design was one of my first and last steps when creating my website. Can you show this
            was the case I implemented a Max width for both mobile and desktop CSS file, so everything I designed in
            both fit across all devices. Ensuring I was successful was not too much of a challenge as this was one of
            the easier parts of designing my website to be mobile friendly.

            Also, including images on my website, I had to optimise them to fit on the screen in both mobile and desktop
            view. With this I used CSS to ensure that the width and height of the image as well as the placement was
            correct. Again the use of tags by setting the max with was very useful in ensuring that my images were
            optimise for both desktop and mobile view.

            When designing the navigation for my desktop, I thought it would be best appear at the top of the screen to
            make it user-friendly and easier to navigate. I allowed for each section of the navigation bar to be
            highlighted, whenever the user drags the cursor over it. This made it easier for them to understand what
            part of the page they are about to navigate to. Optimising this for mobile was done with the use of the
            hamburger icon. In doing this, it will allow mobile users to have a more efficient and effective way of
            navigate in my webpage. A grid layout was also chosen, as it is the most efficient layout to ensure that my
            website was looking neat

            Also, using the default font and sometimes switching, it was a choice I made to ensure that my website was
            user-friendly. I also made the fonts a sensible size to allow users to read text without having to zoom in
            or make changes to the device.
            By following these tips, I was able to make my website user friendly and also provide good user experience
            for both devices.

        <p class="reporttext">Speaking more on the issues I faced, when designing the hamburger icon, the menu kept
            appearing in both the
            desktop and mobile view. It took quite a while for me to realise that my css files weren't sorted correctly,
            as well as the
            fact that I was missing code to optimze and allow the hamburger to disappear on desktop. To create the
            Hamburger Icon, I used the template
            from the slides shown in class, and changed some parts of the code, so it matched my designs </p>

        <p>ignore this for now</p>

        <p class="reporttext"> As well as coding, I also had to ensure that my code was validated throughout. I used the
            website
            "ValidatorW3" in order to achieve this, and below will be screenshots of either my code fully validated or
            the errors
            that were displayed before I changed it for it to be validated.

        <p class="reporttext"> Also, when designing my website, I has to think about a suitable colour to keep
            consistent throughout.
            Originally, I started with black as a basis but decided it was too plain and not interesting enough. The
            reason I chose red
            as the background is because it's: attention-grabbing meaning and a highly noticeable color and can easily
            grab people's attention,
            making it a great choice for this project. It also creates a great contrast if used with the correct design
            elements, which I have chosen.
            The same concept applied when I created the colour-changing background - all shades of red to keep a
            consistent theme.
            Red is also a common color used in branding, so using it would help establish a recognisable and familar
            feeling.
