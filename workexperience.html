        <p2 class="text2"> This was a picture of me taken on the moon working as an astronaut for NASA. My time there
            was enjoyed and I leant so many interesting things, and secrets, which cannot be revealed.
            Overall, working there was one of the best experiences i've had and would hopefully like to work there
            again.

        <p3 class="text2"> This is one of my projects when I was working as engineer for the popular car company,
            Rolls Royce, back in the day. This was one of my first projects and they really were impressed,
            however I did leave due to the corruption of the organisation.

        <p4 class="text2">This photo is of one of my many apprentices that I took on to train in the rap game, in hopes
            they can be a
            successful artist and Polo G here, is one of the artist that has rose up to fame under my wing. You can
            catch his music
            on all major streaming platforms under the alias "Polo G".

        <p5 class="text2">I worked as a coach for the infamous Basket Ball association "NBA". This is one of the players
            that
            was assigned to me, and I had to train him up to have efficient three point and game winning shots. His
            skills massively
            improved through the passing years, as I thought him: how to follow through with the ball, his position, and
            most importantly, the timing of his shots. Now, despite his many injuries, he's considered one of the
            greatest NBA
            players to walk the court.

        <p6 class="text2">I have helped Saka's training with primarily focusing on improving his football skills overall
            , with a
            heavy focus on his technical ability, fitness, and understanding of the game. His
            dedication and hard work has really shown, as he has emerged as one of Arsenal's most promising young
            players
            and an important member of the England national team</p6>

            class="second"> 
        <p7 class="text2"> Pop Smoke is another rapper I took under my wing, and with his unique deep, raspy voice, I knew I would be
            able
            to train him up to become one of the hottest up and coming rappers. Pop Smoke's big break came in 2019 with
            the release of his hit single "Welcome to the Party," which gained traction quickly on social media and
            streaming platforms. The success of the song resulted in a record contract with Republic Records and the
            release of his debut mixtape, "Meet the Woo." Unfortunately, he was tragically shot and killed back in 2020.
