        <p2 class="text2"> This was a picture of me taken on the moon working as an astronaut for NASA. My time there
            was enjoyed and I leant so many interesting things, and secrets, which cannot be revealed.
            Overall, working there was one of the best experiences i've had and would hopefully like to work there again.

        <p3 class="text2"> This is one of my projects when I was working as engineer for the popular car company, 
            Rolls Royce, back in the day. This was one of my first projects and they really were impressed,
            however I did leave due to the corruption of the organisation.
