            had its challenges!
            However, this page showcases some of my most popular, and in my opinion, greatest works.
            Creating each of these posed a challenge, having to deal with clients requests and complients.
            Despite this, I was able to get through this and the end result cocluded with both a happy clients,
            as well as a happy me.

        <p class="text2">Here are some of the images and designs I have taken! I am very happy with these
            and so are the people who I took the image for/ designed for as well.
            These images were at the beginning of my career back in the 2000s, where the tools that we have nowerdays,
            didn't really exist, so I found it quite challenging to work efficiently, compared to the present.</p>
